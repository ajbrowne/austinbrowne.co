									<h2>Team Software Project</h2>
									<h3>Sports Viz</h3>
									<p>Created a sports visualization website for Michigan Tech hockey and broomball. Data was periodically scraped from the corresponding MTU websites and then uploaded to Google Drive via python. Google Drive was used as a database that hooked directly into Google Charts which was the tool used for visualization. The webiste was born in Twitter Bootstrap and runs mostly off of javascript using GSON calls to Google Drive. The site itself shows individual data, statistiscal trends, and side-by-side player comparisons. Users could upload personal team stats from Broomball which would then be translated into charts and graphs.</p>
